    <h4 class="project__subtitle">Australian Electronic Tourist Guide</h4>
    <h5 class="project__heading">Application Overview</h5>
    <p>The Australian Electronic Tourist Guide is a web-based application
      designed to assist road travellers to enjoy their Australian road trips to
      the fullest. It can be accessed on a desktop or tablet, but is more suited
      to be accessed on a mobile device browser.</p>
    <p>It helps users by playing an informational audio when users are on their
      vehicles and approach certain landmarks along Australian roads. These
      landmarks can be tourist attractions open to the public or simply a place
      where important events took place, an illustrious inhabitant that lived in
      the area, remarkable natural landscapes, important economic activity and
      much more. The content options have no limits.</p>
    <h5 class="project__heading">Motivation</h5>
    <p>Have you ever been bored while on the road and looked out the window of
      your car, bus, or train and wondered about the place you are passing by?
      So you know exactly what the feeling is like. </p>
    <p>Australia is incredibly vast and there is so much to see and do along our
      roads. There are uncountable stretches of road with jaw-dropping
      landscapes and interesting histories that attract thousands of national
      and
      international tourists each year.</p>
    <p>However, the availability of information for visitors using our roads is
      limited to written media in books, booklets and tourist guides, both
      published in paper or online. Although information provided in these media
      assist with information about places and events, they do not make the
      trips themselves more interesting and fun. The Australian Electronic
      Tourist
      Guide explores this opportunity.</p>

    <h5 class="project__heading">Feature Description</h5>
    <p>The Australian Electronic Tourist Guide is a web-based application that
      users start up by accessing a URL on a mobile device browser (preferred).
      The user interface is simple and clean. As it is optimised for small
      screens (approximately 400 x 600px) not a lot of information is displayed
      at any one time.</p>
    <p>The application website opens up showing a lean navigation bar up the
      top. The navigation bar has a logo and a hamburger navigation button with
      the following links: Home, Routes, Login.</p>
    <h6 class="project__subheading">Home Page</h6>
    <p>The Home page has a description of the service with illustrating images
      and information on the cost of the service and possible plans. The
      information is presented in text for the information and by tiles with
      images and descriptions for the levels of service. At the top there is a
      call-to-action button inviting users to sign up for the service. There is
      another call-to-action button inviting the user who is not ready to sign
      up just yet to view the Routes page. A Footer section at the bottom of the
      page links to the application social media channels and other affiliated
      tourism service providers and government links.</p>
    <h6 class="project__subheading">Routes</h6>
    <p>The Routes page is accessible by pressing the Home page specific
      call-to-action button and the navigation button link. Suggested route
      tiles are listed sorted by region. Similar to the Home page, at the top
      there is a call-to-action button inviting visitors to sign up for the
      service.</p>
    <h6 class="project__subheading">Sign Up/Login Services</h6>
    <p>The ‘Sign Up’ feature allows a user to access a shopping cart with basic
      eCommerce functionality to allow users to subscribe to service plans. This
      service is linked to credit card providers and charges the user
      credit/debit card and organises the funds transfer between the parties.
    </p>
    <p>The ‘Login’ feature performs user authentication and checks if a user is
      authorised to access the ‘Electronic Tourist Guide’ service.</p>
    <h6 class="project__subheading">My Routes Services</h6>
    <p>The ‘My Routes’ feature allows users to search and save routes among the
      catalogue of routes in the application database. Saved routes are stored
      in a ‘Favourites’ section of the page. In the ‘Completed Routes’ section,
      users can indicate which routes they have already completed.</p>
    <h6 class="project__subheading">Electronic Tourist Guide Services</h6>
    <p>The main feature of the application, the ‘Electronic Tourist Guide’ is
      started when a subscriber user presses the relevant button. It starts a
      navigation map with the user current location and starts reading the user
      location in the background. The user location is refreshed every 15
      seconds. When a user enters an area of proximity with a landmarked point,
      an audio file is played on the mobile device by the browser sound player.
      The proximity parameters are variable according to the user location and
      the landmark involved to account for differences in landmark density in
      different areas of the country (e.g. Sydney CBD vs Central NT). The audio
      player has standard sound controls, such as play/pause, forward/rewind,
      stop and skip buttons. After the audio stops playing, the app resumes
      reading the user location and the process starts again. </p>

    <p>To implement a tool with the features described above, I believe the
      technologies below (or variations) would be used as well as resources with
      knowledge and experience in their implementation and maintenance. Note: by
      no means this is an exhaustive list and, most likely, as is the case with
      many web development projects, other tools are added along the way.</p>

    <h6 class="project__subheading">Outcome</h6>
    <p>The Australian Electronic Tourist Guide will support Local and State
      governments to provide a better experience to the general public using
      Australian roads, therefore having an impact on the tourism experience
      satisfaction. This will, in turn, assist in increasing the profile of the
      Tourism industry in Australia and to bring more visitors each year into
      Australia and into the States and territories, generating jobs and
      business opportunities.</p>
