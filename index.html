          <h3>Personal Information</h3>
          <p>Hi, I'm Daniel Barros. I’m a Front-end Web
            Developer based out of
            Perth, Australia. I bring to life fun, innovative, accessible, and
            fast websites. I try to leave every bit of code I touch more
            readable,
            modular, performant, accessible and maintainable than I found it.
          </p>
          <p>When I'm not bringing design ideas into life, I like to read about
            technology or watch science documentaries or sports.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <p>After approximately 20 years working in Human Resources, I have
        switched careers into IT working with Information Systems. I’m now
        pursuing Bachelor Degree in Information Technology, attempting to
        concentrate further on Computer Science subjects. My career goal is
        to
        move into a more technical role, initially as a Software Developer
        and
        then move onto corporate Software Architecture.</p>
      <div class="profile__part2">
        <div class="profile__part2-text-box">
          <p>I was born and grew up in tropical Brazil where I finished school,
            my
            first Bachelor Degree in Business (Human Resources) and a Master
            Degree in Marketing, before coming to Australia and doing a second
            Master Degree in Human Resources. Apart from English, I also speak
            Portuguese (native) and can speak some Spanish, which has many
            similarities to Portuguese.</p>
          <p>Outside of my career, when I was younger, I played Futsal (an
            indoor
            variation of soccer) at a competitive level, having won the WA State
            League 2 times and competing in a national league, both as a player
            and coach.</p>

      <h3 class="interest__title">Interest in IT</h3>
      <p>My interest in IT started when I was a kid playing games and fiddling
        around with my parents’ personal computer. I just found it amazing back
        in the day that so much information could be put in a digital format:
        images, video, music and so much more. I soon learned that it had many
        Productivity uses as well, and connectivity. With the internet,
        everything changed. Suddenly everything got connected, everyone got
        connected. Businesses got connected. I also found incredible the speed
        in which progress was made.</p>
      <p>Since then I developed a keen interest in everything tech-related. This
        should have been sufficient for me to pick IT as a career. However, I
        ended
        up pursuing other interests at the time.</p>
      <p>A couple of years ago I started taking online courses on Web
        Development and
        I really enjoyed it. Now, I am finally prioritising a career that (I
        believe) I am more suited to. I am enrolled in the Bachelor of IT with
        RMIT
        and have also recently changed careers into IT, working with healthcare
        Information Systems. The systems area interest me a lot as I worked with
        enterprise systems and data analysis throughout my whole career. Outside
        of
        work, I am interested in games and interface design. Although I’ve had
        limited contact with, I find the practical applications of Machine
        Learning
        and Artificial Intelligence exciting.</p>
      <p>I chose RMIT online through Open Universities Australia (OUA) as I
        believe
        this is the best option currently in the market to study IT and Computer
        Science online at a Bachelor Degree level. I find that having 4 study
        periods throughout the year can speed up my studies as I am only
        available
        part-time. Both RMIT and OUA have extensive experience in the online
        delivery of the course. In addition, the RMIT is nationally and
        internationally recognised for its excellence in academic and research
        in
        Technology.</p>
      <p>During my studies, I plan to learn a lot about Technology. I will
        endeavour to focus my studies around topics including Programming and
        Software Design and Development as much as possible and to be exposed to
        technology stacks used by industry, such as Java, the Microsoft stack,
        Mobile applications, and open source web technologies. I also have a
        keen interest in Intelligent Systems and Artificial Intelligence, and
        Internet of Things with simple Robotics. Unfortunately, currently these
        are not topics available through RMIT/OUA Bachelor of IT course. But,
        given the rise of importance of these topics, it is possible that before
        I graduate, units covering these topics may be introduced as electives.
