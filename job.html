    <h3>Ideal Job Analysis</h3>
    <p>My ideal job is a job at a company that is on the forefront of technology
      and Software Development. The company I wish to work for is reputable both
      within the industry and outside of it. It has a reputation of being an
      innovator and its products are widely used worldwide. The software it
      produces provide excellent user experience and are regarded as market
      leaders. </p>
    <p>I want to work for a company that I am proud be working at and that
      provides a challenging, flexible, engaging and fun work environment, that
      can provide a variety of experiences, development opportunities and
      exposure to different technologies. If all that can come at a remuneration
      package that is above industry average, that’s even better.</p>
    <section class="job-description">
      <h4>UX Engineer, Front End (Web), Google</h4>
      <div class="job-description__box">
        <div class="job-description__text">
          <p>The UX Engineer position at Google seems to be a great job. Google
            seems to be a company that perfectly fulfils my requirements listed
            above and the position itself appears to provide an environment that
            is challenging and offers unmeasurable growth opportunities. To
            access the full job description, click on the image on the right.
          </p>
          <p>In terms of the required qualifications, the description seems to
            be reasonable. Although I currently don’t have all the technical
            knowledge and experience that the position requires, I am on my way.
            And, given my previous experiences and background, I could bring the
            diversity that a position like this could benefit from.</p>
          <p>The description of the work environment and the position outcomes
            is particularly appealing. The holder of this position will be on
            the developing products on the forefront of web collaborative
            systems, and changing the way people interact with Technology. The
            locations of these positions also appear interesting for a change of
            environment. They are located in the US, mostly in California. An
            experience like this in the curriculum would most certainly qualify
            myself on my return to work on any software development company in
            Australia.</p>
          <p>As a minimum, it requires a BA in a Computer Science-related or
            Design
            field or equivalent experience, plus experience with web
            development,
            and interface design. It requires 6 years of coding experience in
            web
            technologies or Java or C/C++ and knowledge of web frameworks, such
            as
            Angular. It also requires some knowledge of scripting languages like
            Python or Ruby. A lot of behavioural skills are also values, as per
            the ad description.</p>
          <p>At the moment, I already know and use comfortably all the web
            technologies listed in the job ad, apart from a web development
            back-end framework. I have already done some development in Python
            and
            have become more familiar with Java and C lately through RMIT units.
            With years of industry experience, I believe I have the behavioural
            traits that the position requires, such as curiosity, adaptability,
            in
            addition to good communication and problem-solving skills.</p>
          <p>To bridge the gap between where I am now and where I want to be, I
            need to graduate from my degree, possibly with a remarkable academic
            standing. During my degree I need to get exposure to a varied range
            of
            technologies, especially in web development, specialise in a
            back-end
            framework, as well as getting more familiar with the hardware side
            of
            things and aspects of Networking, Security and Computer Systems.
            Probably my biggest challenge will be to fill the gap in experience.
            I
            believe I will need to start working as a full-time developer to get
            commercial development experience, preferably in a position that
            provides opportunities to work closely with User Experience design.
