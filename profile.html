        personality tests I took to have more insight into what my preferences
        are when collaborating in teams.</p>
      <!-- Start Myers-Briggs Test Results -->
      <article class="profile__myers">
        <h4 class="profile_myers-title">Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) [1]
        </h4>
        <p class="profile__bold">Introverted - 68%</p>
        <p>As an Introvert, you are primarily focused inward, on your own
          thoughts, feelings, and experiences. Most of the time, you find it
          more
          energizing to be in quiet, peaceful surroundings than to be surrounded
          by noise or large groups of people. You tend to be reserved and keep
          your thoughts to yourself.</p>
        <p class="profile__bold">Sensing – 54%, Intuitive – 46%</p>
        <p>Your energy style is a blend of Sensing and Intuition, and as such,
          you
          are neither a pure Sensor nor a pure Intuitive. Because you do show a
          slight preference for Sensing, we can classify you as a Sensor type.
          However, it’s more accurate to say that you are a bit of both Sensor
          and
          Intuitive: you tend to use both styles in processing information, and
          you may switch from one to the other depending on the demands of your
          environment.</p>
        <p class="profile__bold">Thinking – 71%</p>
        <p>As a Thinker, you are driven by a desire to pursue rational, logical
          reasoning. You tend to think about things in a detached, unemotional
          manner, and are most comfortable when you can reason through an issue
          logically. You are disinterested in personal appeals, preferring your
          decisions to be objective. You can be competitive with others, and
          don't
          mind ruffling a few feathers to achieve your goals.</p>
        <p class="profile__bold">Judging – 78%</p>
        <p>As a Judger, you prefer to approach your life with a sense of
          structure
          and order. You like things planned and scheduled, and dislike
          unexpected
          changes. You tend to maintain systems of organization appreciate
          structured environments. It is important to you to follow through on
          your promises, and you consider yourself responsible and reliable.</p>
        <p class="profile__bold">ISTJ - The Inspector</p>
        <p>ISTJs are responsible organizers, driven to create and enforce order
          within systems and institutions. They are neat and orderly, inside and
          out, and tend to have a procedure for everything they do. Reliable and
          dutiful, ISTJs want to uphold tradition and follow regulations.</p>
        <p>ISTJs are steady, productive contributors. Although they are
          Introverted,
          ISTJs are rarely isolated; typical ISTJs know just where they belong
          in
          life, and want to understand how they can participate in established
          organizations and systems. They concern themselves with maintaining
          the
          social order and making sure that standards are met.</p>
        <p class="profile__bold">Strengths</p>
        <p><span class="profile__underline">Perseverance</span>. The ISTJ’s main
          and most admirable strength is perseverance; people of this type
          simply
          do not give up. This trait is advantageous to them and can be that
          which
          sets them apart in their careers. Their peers and competitors may
          possess greater skills, but few will match the ISTJ in dogged
          commitment.</p>
        <p><span class="profile__underline">Planning</span>. Because of the
          ISTJ’s
          Judging component, people of this type have a very clear command of
          time
          and priorities. They are quite skilledin planning, organizing, mapping
          out schedules and following agendas. They excel in time management,
          are
          punctual (and demand the same of others) and consistently meet their
          deadlines.</p>
        <p><span class="profile__underline">Detail orientation</span>. ISTJs
          notice holes, gaps, errors that broader thinkers don’t. They like
          facts,
          details and numbers without the emotional or interpretive fluff. And
          they don’t take facts or information for granted, nor do they rely on
          it
          simply because someone else said so. They will check things out for
          themselves, meticulously.</p>
        <p><span class="profile__underline">Loyalty</span>. ISTJs also have a
          natural instinct to protect and defend. Loyal, reliable and committed,
          these are people that can be depended on to guard everything from
          their
          families to our nation and these are responsibilities they proudly
          assume. To the institutions, organizations and people to which they
          are
          committed, they are unwavering in their
          service.</p>
        <p class="profile__bold">Weaknesses</p>
        <p><span class="profile__underline">Stubbornness</span>. While ISTJs
          will
          be admired for their unwavering commitment to their duty and their
          sense
          of what is right and proper, the down side of this is that they can be
          stubborn, inflexible and dogmatic. They often believe there is one
          right
          way (theirs) and things must be done that way. Everything else is, by
          default, wrong.</p>
        <p><span class="profile__underline">Tactlessness</span>. The ISTJ's
          fierce
          commitment to truth can also get them in trouble in interpersonal
          dealings. They tend to speak without much consideration for the
          feelings
          of others, thinking it is always more important to be truthful than to
          make people feel good. They may even experience internal conflict
          around
          trying to be tactful or diplomatic, sensing that they are not being
          completely honest, direct or straightforward.</p>
        <p><span class="profile__underline">Guilt</span>. ISTJs take their work,
          their commitments and really all aspects of their lives quite
          seriously
          and they work hard to plan well and to make wise decisions. When
          things
          don’t go as planned, however, they may blame and beat themselves up
          about it, second guess their decisions and suffer guilt. They will
          have
          a hard time simply accepting that sometimes life doesn’t go as
          planned,
          and will feel a sense of personal failure and defeat. This can be a
          source of stress and on-going rumination.</p>
        <p><span class="profile__underline">Resistance to change</span>. ISTJs,
          in
          their drive to uphold tradition and do things by the book, can be
          resistant to change and innovation. Suspicious of new advances and
          ways
          of doing things, not only do they experience strain when called upon
          to
          embrace change, they also often stifle creativity or fail to
          appreciate
          the benefit of approaching old problems in new ways. This can limit
          their potential and make them seem especially difficult and stodgy to
          their co-workers and subordinates.</p>

        <h4 class="profile__big5-title">Big 5 Personality Test [2]</h4>
        <h6 class="profile__big5-subtitle">Core Pattern</h6>
        <p>This circumplex describes the essential role you take on in
          approaching the world. This role is a reflection of your core values
          and motivations, as well as the way you think about things.</p>
        <img src="/img/big5_result.png" alt="" class="profile__big5-image">
        <h6 class="profile__big5-subtitle">How does your mind work?</h6>
        <p>You are a concrete thinker who focuses on straightforward facts. You
          are good at noticing and remembering details that you have observed.
          You are not particularly creative or imaginative in your thinking,
          preferring to think about what is clear and observable in your
          environment. In making decisions, you rely on provable facts and
          evidence. You focus on real life and first-hand experience, and you
          are occupied with thoughts of practical action.</p>
        <p>You are a critical thinker and often analyse how things (and people)
          around you could be improved. You are keenly aware of the ways in
          which others disappoint you, and you often think about ways in which
          you can gain the upper hand. You are not afraid to point out what is
          wrong in the world, and your thoughts are blunt and unsparing in their
          judgment.</p>
        <p>Your thinking is often disturbed by unpleasant thoughts, and you may
          have trouble focusing. You may be troubled by anxiety and feelings of
          unworthiness which make it difficult to think clearly.</p>

        <h4 class="profile__learning-title">Learning Style Test [3]</h4>
        <ul class="profile__learning-highlight-list">
          <li class="profile__learning-highlight">Auditory: 25%</li>
          <li class="profile__learning-highlight">Visual: 35%</li>
          <li class="profile__learning-highlight">Tactile: 40%</li>
        </ul>
        <h6 class="profile__learning-subtitle">Tactile</h6>
        <p>If you are a tactile learner, you learn by touching and doing. You
          understand and remember things through physical movement. You are a
          "hands-on" learner who prefers to touch, move, build, or draw what you
          learn, and you tend to learn better when some type of physical
          activity is involved. You need to be active and take frequent breaks,
          you often speak with your hands and with gestures, and you may have
          difficulty sitting still.</p>
        <p>As a tactile learner, you like to take things apart and put things
          together, and you tend to find reasons to tinker or move around when
          you become bored. You may be very well coordinated and have good
          athletic ability. You can easily remember things that were done but
          may have difficulty remembering what you saw or heard in the process.
          You often communicate by touching, and you appreciate physically
          expressed forms of encouragement, such as a pat on the back.</p>
        <p>Here are some things that tactile learners like you can do to learn
          better:</p>
        <ul class="profile__learning-tip-list">
          <li class="profile__learning-tip">Participate in activities that
            involve touching, building, moving, or drawing.</li>
          <li class="profile__learning-tip">Do lots of hands-on activities like
            completing art projects, taking walks, or acting out stories.</li>
          <li class="profile__learning-tip">It's OK to chew gum, walk around, or
            rock in a chair while reading or studying.</li>
          <li class="profile__learning-tip">Use flashcards and arrange them in
            groups to show relationships between ideas.</li>
          <li class="profile__learning-tip">Trace words with your finger to
            learn spelling (finger spelling).</li>
          <li class="profile__learning-tip">Take frequent breaks during reading
            or studying periods (frequent, but not long).</li>
          <li class="profile__learning-tip">It's OK to tap a pencil, shake your
            foot, or hold on to something while learning.</li>
          <li class="profile__learning-tip">Use a computer to reinforce learning
            through the sense of touch.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Remember that you learn best by doing, not just by reading, seeing,
          or hearing.</p>
      </article>
      <!-- Start of Test Results Analysis -->
      <article class="profile__analysis">
        <h4 class="profile__analysis-title">Analysis</h4>
        <p>The results confirmed previous personality and learning style tests I
          took when I was younger. I believe my profile to be highly suitable
          for analytic skills that require a lot of attention to details and I
          am happier working in activities that require more focus time rather
          than a lot of social interaction. That’s not to say though that I like
          to be isolated and dislike collaboration. But I have a strength and
          preference for the more analytical tasks.</p>
        <p>What sparked interest in the test results was the amount of negative
          consequences of this personality profile, with a lot of opportunities
          for excessive stress and anxiety, and frustration.</p>
        <p>Whilst focused work and attention to details are strengths and come
          naturally in an individual with my personality profile, in a team, I
          need to make conscientious effort to excel in collaboration and
          communication as these are not second-nature. Occasionally, I may
          present a tendency to assume that other people understand what I mean
          and to have the same information that I have. This may come across as
          difficult to work with and even arrogant, due to the level of detail
          and
          high-quality standards imposed on my work and life in general.</p>
        <p>Although the likelihood of conflicts is higher, stronger teams have
          people from a variety of profiles, so that all skills are covered, and
          availability of a wider range of ideas and perspectives. Overcoming
          disagreements is also believed to increase group success, when managed
          appropriately. I would be well-suited for a team in which there are
          other individuals with more extraverted profiles to achieve a more
          balanced approach to problem-solving.</p>
